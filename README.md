- App Version: `v1a`
- Bazel Version: `4.2.1`

Base point-of-sale adapter tooling. Provides adapter structure and central definitions for vendor implementation modules.


## Getting Started

The application is built using Bazel, with the backend and frontend both written in Node. Bazel is driven by the project's `Makefile`.


To build the app:
```
> git clone git@github.com:OpenCannabis/pos-adapter-base.git ./adapter-base && cd adapter-base && make
```

To run the tests:
```
make test
```


### Using the `Makefile`

To get a list of commands supported by the `Makefile`, you can just run `make help`:
```
pos-adapter-base:
all                            Build and test the sample application.
build                          Build the sample application via Bazel.
clean                          Clean ephemeral build targets. Always safe to run.
deploy                         Re-render Kubernetes configurations to prep a deploy.
distclean                      Clean any development state. Wipes `.dev`.
ensure-deps                    Force-run dependency install routines (ideal for use in CI).
expunge                        Perform a distclean and expunge via Bazel.
forceclean                     DANGEROUS: Perform all clean steps, force reset any git state, and drop untracked files.
help                           Show this help text.
image                          Build the app image via Bazel.
reset                          DANGEROUS: Reset any git state.
resetup                        Clean the dev environment only, and re-initialize it. Automatically run after dep updates.
run                            Build and run the sample application via Bazel.
sources                        Re-render templated sources, like the README.
status                         Display status of the local dev environment.
test                           Run the testsuite for the sample application via Bazel.
```
